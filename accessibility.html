        <h2>Why accessibility</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is important to consider when developing a website. It ensures that the program is usable for people with disabilities. The user experience gets more inclusive and the platforms reach out to a more diverse audience.
          We performed both the Wave test and Lighthouse test for the accessibility test. Performing two tests was to ensure the accessibility to our page is as including as possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Before testing</h2>
        <p>Before doing the test we already had some key thoughts in mind when making our website.</p>
        <p>We made sure we have text alternatives to images (alt attributes). We also chose to use the roboto font, because this font is known for having good readability.</p>
        <p>Our website is separated into titles, headings, and paragraphs - improving readability. We mostly have high contrast for our backgrounds and text. The navigation menu is strategically placed in the top right corner. It is most likely users find this predictable, also making it user-friendly. The language on our page is in English, making it accessible for more people, for example international students.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>The first test</h2>
        <p>
          The first time we tested on Lighthouse, we had 100% accessibility rate on most of our pages. However, on two pages, we scored 77% and 92%. This was due to having insufficient contrast between background and text, as well as not using list elements in our list. When doing the Wave test, we got the same results.
        </p>
        <p>Even though no errors were detected in most cases, there were still room for improvement. Therefore, in addition to fixing the few accessibility errors we got, we looked at additional items to check manually that Lighthouse provided for us.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Final results</h2>
        <p>After making changes, we managed to get a good score on our whole website, both on Wave test and Lighthouse test. We made sure to make the contrast better, therefore changing the image caption color underneath one of the images. We ensured to change the color when hovering over links. This will help confirm where the link leads to.
          Underneath is an example of coding choices we made to make the website more accessible. This is the "hovering-effect", where the text of a link changes colour when the user hover over it. This is an often used effect to illustrate that text is an active, clickable link.  </p>
