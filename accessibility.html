        <h2>Before testing:</h2>
        <p>Before doing the test we already had some key thoughts in mind when making our website.</p>
<p>We made sure we have text alternatives to images (alt attributes).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Readable and understandable:</h2>
<p>Our website is separated into titles, headings, and paragraphs - improving readability. We mostly have high contrast for our background and text and links. The navigation menu is strategically placed in top right corner. It is most likely users find this predictable, also making it user-friendly. The language on our page is in English, making it accessible for more people, for example international students.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>The first test:</h2>
        <p>
          The first time we tested on Lighthouse, we had 100% accessibility rate on most of our pages. However, on two pages, we scored 77% and 92%. This was due to having insufficient contrast between background and text, as well as not using list elements in our list. When doing the Wave test, we got the same results.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Changes made:</h2>
        <p>
          Even though no errors were detected in most cases, there were still room for improvement. Therefore, in addition to fixing the few accessibility errors we got, we looked at additional items to check manually that Lighthouse provided for us.
